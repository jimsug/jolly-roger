# Installation

## Firefox

For Firefox, download and install the `.xpi` file. You might get a warning about it being dangerous - you need to accept this to complete installation.

You _should_ receive updates automatically, but it's probably worth checking this page before you start a hunt.

## Chrome

We don't distribute this via the Chrome Web Store, so Chromium-based browsers can't install the extension that way.

### Unpacked extension

1. Download and unpack `jolly-roger-chrome.zip` to a directory - you need to keep it there while you're using the extension.
2. Go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder you unzipped the extension to.

You'll need to update the add-on manually.

### CRX file

1. Download the `.crx` file. (You might need to check your downloads and confirm the download of a "dangerous" file.)
2. Go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Drag the downloaded `.crx` file and drop it anywhere on the page.

You'll need to update the add-on manually.
